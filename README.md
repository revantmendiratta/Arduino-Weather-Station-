# Arduino-Weather-Station-
This Arduino Weather Station project showcases how to create a basic weather monitoring system using an Arduino Mega, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, a DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, and an LCD screen. The weather station displays the current temperature, humidity, and time, providing real-time weather updates.
